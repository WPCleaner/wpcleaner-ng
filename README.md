# WPCleaner Next Generation

WPCleaner Next Generation is a tool designed to help with various maintenance tasks on wikis run with MediaWiki software.
It is a full rewrite of the original [WPCleaner](https://github.com/WPCleaner/wpcleaner) to modernize it.

It's written in Java (currently version 17)
and uses the [Spring framework](https://spring.io/)
and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot/).
